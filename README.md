### SkillHarvest HR Attrition Analysis Using Microsoft Power Bi

### Introduction
During my sojourn at SkillHarvest, we worked on several data. HR Attrition Analytics happens to be one of them, leveraging data visualization to extract key insights concerning the organization’s attrition rates.

In the HR Management world, understanding why employees leave involves digging into who they are and how they’re feeling. Demographics tell the story — each employee is a unique puzzle piece. Looking at attrition through this lens helps HR management see patterns and individual tales, shaping strategies that fit everyone.

Employee wellness is very important. Like a wise man once said, “To do great things, you need a plan and not quite enough time.” Wellness is that plan. Taking care of physical and mental well-being not only keeps employees happy but also makes them stick around. In the interplay between demographics and wellness, HR management maps a smart route, knowing a happy team is the real secret to organizational success.

### Dataset Overview
The dataset used for the HR attrition analysis contains 1470 rows and 35 columns, each revealing a unique facet of the organizational landscape. Core columns, such as employee number, age, and gender, offer fundamental insights into the demographic makeup of the workforce. The “attrition” column, split into “yes” and “no,” serves as the focus, driving the analysis of employee turnover. Additional parameters, ranging from department and marital status to job involvement, satisfaction levels, monthly income, and tenure-related metrics like years in the current role and years since the last promotion, create a detailed understanding of the dynamics within the organization. This dataset serves as a base for a comprehensive exploration of the factors influencing attrition, allowing for a detailed examination of the interplay between personal and professional variables that shape the employment journey.

### Data Visualization
I used data visualizations to extract crucial insights into the organization’s attrition rates. These findings serve as a valuable resource for employers, allowing them to pinpoint the reasons behind employee turnover. By identifying these factors, organizations can implement necessary adjustments to work practices and policies, ensuring the retention of their top-performing employees.
